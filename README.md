# Credit-Scoring-Using-A-Credit-Risk-Model

For any organisation in a position of handing our credit facilities to individuals and corporations, a major due diligence procedure in analysing each applican'ts probability of paying back thesaid credit facility. More than just havng to do that, a seamless and automated process that accurately gets this job done could save the organisation hours of sifting through data trying to figure out who is qualified for a credit facility, or not.

The purpose of this initiative is to train a credit risk model that attempts to score applicants based on their varying characteristics using the knowledge it learned from how past data was generated, and the resulting outcome.
